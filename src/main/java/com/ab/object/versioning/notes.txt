-> This feature of hibernate is used to keep track of how many time object/record is modified through hibernate persistence logic. It will maintain one numeric counter keeping track of that changes.

-> to mark the properties of entity class as the versioning property use <version> tag or @Version annotation and this property type must be numeric type.

-> use case::
    -> Keeping track of how many times how many times atm service is used
    -> Keeping track of how many times how many times address or phone number is changed in the bank.
    -> Also useful locking of the object to prevent simultaneous modification.

-> Bringing this effect without hibernate is possible using JDBC but we need to use the complex triggers support.
